## Overview
This test script automates the testing of a web page's calculator functionality. It opens the calculator, enters two random numbers, performs a calculation, and then verifies that the displayed result matches the expected sum of the entered numbers. This script uses Selenium's WebDriver to interact with web elements and TestNG for test management and assertions.
